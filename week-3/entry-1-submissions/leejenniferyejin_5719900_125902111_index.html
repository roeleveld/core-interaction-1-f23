        Found Letters in NYC collects hidden letterforms on the streets, buildings, 
        subways and nature of New York City. This passion project was started by 
        Jennifer Lee, who is currently studying Communication Design at <a href=https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/bfa-communication-design/Parsons style="text-decoration:none">Parsons School of Design</a>, NY.
