        <p>Every winter, as December approaches the new year, Dutch towns are full of the fried scent of <i>Oliebollen</i>.
            <br> Like a New Orleans beignet, these fried dough balls are made of a yeasted batter, but these are studded with chopped apples and raisins. The raisins caramelise in the hot oil, and the apples soften – a perfect backdrop for the avalanche
            of powdered sugar these are blanketed in.
