<p> <h6>    I</h6></p>
<p>Said the Table to the Chair</p>
<p> <h5> 'You can hardly be aware,</h5> </p>
<p> <h5>How I suffer from the heat,</h5></p>
<p> <h5>'And from chilblains on my feet!</h5></p>
<p><h5>'If we took a little walk,</h5> 
    <p><h5> We might have a little talk!</h5> </p>
   <p><h5>'Pray let us take air!'</h5></p> 
</p>
<p><h5>II</h5></p> 
<p><strong>Said the Chair unto the Table</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>'Now you know we are not able!</li>
    <li>'How foolishly you talk,</li>
    <li>'When you know we cannot walk!'</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Said the Table, with a sigh</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>'It can do no harm to try,</li>
    <li>'I've as many legs as you,</li>
    <li>'I've as many legs as you,</li>
    <li>'Why can't we walk on two?'</li>
</ul>
<p> <h4>    III</h4></p>
<div>  So they both went slowly <i>down</i> , </div>
<p>And walked about the <i>town</i> </p>
<p> With a cheerful bumpy <strong>sound</strong>,</p>
<p> As they toddled round and <strong>round</strong>.</p>
<p> And everybody <i>cried</i>,</p>
<p> As they hastened to their <i>side</i>,</p>
<p> 'See! the Table and the <strong>Chair</strong></p>
<p> 'Have come out to take the <strong>air</strong>!'</p>
<p> <h3>    IV</h3></p>
<pre>But 
     in 
        going 
            down
                an
                    alley
</pre>
<p> To a castle in a valley,</p>
<p> They completely lost their way,</p>
<pre> And they w a n  d e  r  e  d</pre>
<p> Till, to see them safely back,</p>
<ol>
<strong>They paid a</strong>
    <li>Ducky-quack,</li>
    <li>And a Beetle,</li>
    <li>And a Mouse,</li>
</ol>
<p> Who took them to their house.</p>
<p> <h2>    V</h2></p>
<span> Then they <small>whispered</small> to each other,</span>
<p> <small>'O delightful little brother!</small></p>
</small></p>
<p> <small>'What a lovely walk we've taken!</small>
<p><small>'Let us dine on Beans and Bacon!'</small> </p>
<p> So the Ducky, and the leetle</p>
<p> Browny-Mousy and the Beetle</p>
<p> Dined, and danced upon their heads</p>
<p> Till they toddled to their beds.</p>
